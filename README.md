## Management

I have worked on this team as the manager, traking down the time of each task produced and keeping the record of the meetings and events that we made, while watching over the milestones and calendar procedures that had to be delivered.

## Art

Along with the documents that I have kept as a manager, I have also contributed to the artistic part of the project, some of the tasks that I have made are:

 - Map art and arrangement, for Kakariko, the Castle and the houses
 - Character design, including Link and Zelda
 - Character animations, for Link, Zelda, Ganon and other NPCs
 - Introduction and credit scenes
